# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the project

Pyber is a Python-based ridesharing app, we perform the current analysis to help this company to explore many types of visualizations. To achieve the assigned task, we wrote Python scripts with the help of Pandas libraries, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib,a platform for data visualization and graphical plotting library used for the creation of charts that showcase relationships between the data. 

Our main data was divided in:
- Type of city.
- Number of drivers.
- Number of riders.
- Percentage of total fares.
- Percentage of riders and drivers by type of city.

Next, we will discuss about the outcomes that this analysis produced. 


## Summary

<img width="735" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-11 at 12 09 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113856917/201402655-d5634efe-b816-4dc7-b817-e0e9404e3570.png">

As we can see in the figure 1, there are huge variations between the data of the type of cities. 
If we compare the average fare per driver, we have a difference of approximately 10 dollars between urban and rural, this means, the more drivers, the lower rate because there is gonna be less demand, as outcome we will have that the company is offering a better service in the Urban area, having enough drivers to complete the rides, while in the Suburban and Rural areas, there is a lack of drivers, and this could mean that there is an area of opportunity for the company to expand and be able to satisfy the needs of the population of these zones.

The figure 2, the line chart reflects the variations we were talking about as well. 

## Results 
Based on the results we may provide three business recommendations to improve the service in all the regions. 
1. Increase the number of drivers in the suburban and rural areas, this will decrease the average fare per driver and improve the service. 
2. Decrease the average fare per ride in the suburban and rural areas, so the people can access to the service easier. 
3. Launch a marketing campaign to give benefits to new users in the app for the first ride so they get to know the service and get comfortable with it.
